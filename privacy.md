# Privacy Policy

Workshop Toolbox only collects data necessary to perform its tasks. All the data Workshop Toolbox needs is stored in the browser, and never leaves the browser. We won't share or sell your data, not now, not ever.

The rest of this document describes what data is used, where it is stored, and for how long. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me at karel.kroeze@gmail.com.

## Data Collection and Storage

Without linking a Github account, Workshop Toolbox stores;

### the Steam Workshop pages you visit

Workshop Toolbox maintains a list of workshop items you've visited, so that you can apply settings for each item individually. Only the name and url of each item is stored. The list of items is stored in the browsers synced storage, so that it is shared over multiple devices if you have enabled the relevant browser options.

### any quick reply templates you create

Workshop Toolbox stores the templates you create, because you wouldn't be able to use them otherwise. Templates are stored in the browsers synced storage, so that it is shared over multiple devices if you have enabled the relevant browser options.

## Data Collection and Storage - GitHub account

When you link a GitHub account, Workshop Toolbox stores and processes a bit more data;

### Token exchange

When you authenticate with GitHub, a token exchange takes place between GitHub, your browser, and a server controlled by us. This three-way exchange allows GitHub to ensure both your identity, and that of Workshop Toolbox in what is called a [code grant flow](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/authorization-code-request/). Our server acts as a passthrough for an access token, but it does not store the token, or any other information.

### Token storage

When the Workshop Toolbox browser extension receives the token, it is stored in the browsers synced storage, so that it is shared over multiple devices if you have enabled the relevant browser options. You can delete the token in the extension options, or revoke the token through your GitHub account.

### Public repositories

When you create an issue, or assign a default repository to a workshop item, Workshop Toolbox obtains and stores a list of public repositories linked with your account. The list is only stored temporarily to speed up future issues, but when you assign a default repository the name of that repository is stored in the browsers synced storage.

### Issues

When you create an issue, Workshop Toolbox obtains and stores a list of open issues for the repository you have selected. This list is temporarily stored to speed up further issues, but cleared when you close the browser. When you create an issue or post a comment to an existing issue, the contents of the issue and/or comment are directly transferred to GitHub.

## Data Sharing

We do not share or sell your data with anyone. We do not collect any data that is not absolutely necessary. Whenever possible, data about you never leaves your browser.

When you use Workshop Toolbox to create an issue or post a comment to an existing issue, the contents of the issue and/or comment are directly transferred to GitHub.

## Data Ownership

We strongly believe that any data _about you_ should be _owned by you_. As your data never leaves your browser, you are in control. You can access, delete, correct or update all your data directly.
